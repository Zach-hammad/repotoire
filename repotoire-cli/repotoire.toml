# Repotoire self-analysis configuration
# This project is a code analysis tool — some detectors trigger on their own patterns.

[detectors.regex-in-loop]
# All regex patterns use OnceLock<Regex> (compiled once, cached).
# The detector sees Regex::new() in the call chain but can't trace the OnceLock.
enabled = false

[detectors.missing-docstrings]
# Internal module — docs are in code comments and README, not docstrings on every fn.
enabled = false

[detectors.influential-code]
# Overlaps with degree-centrality; compound escalation over-promotes to HIGH.
enabled = false

[detectors.degree-centrality]
# Raise threshold — hub functions like find() and add_node() are by design.

[detectors.deep-nesting]
# Parser code has legitimate deep nesting for AST traversal.

[detectors.unwrap-without-context]
# Internal tool — panics are acceptable for unrecoverable states.
